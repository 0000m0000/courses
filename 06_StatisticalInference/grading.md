## Grading and logistics

The grading in this class is very easy. 

There are four quizzes, each containing in the neighborhood of 10 questions.

Each question is equally weighted. 

Your total points is the sum of the questions across all quizzes that
you answered correctly (using all of your quiz attempts).

70% or more of the total points is a pass for the class. 

80% or more of the total points is a pass with distinction.
